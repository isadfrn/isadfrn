### About Me

- Hello! I'm a Computer Science Bachelor, a Master's student of Applied Computing, and a Software Engineer.
- You can shoot me an [email](mailto:isadfrn@gmail.com) and I'll try to respond as soon as I can.
- I use my GitHub with my students, my work, as a sandbox for learning and also for my side projects. So there's a lot of repositories here, with multiple programming languages and spoken languages. I try to make it the most organized as possible, but if you want to see my projects as a portfolio, please check my [personal page](https://isabellanunes.dev/) for a more detailed view.
